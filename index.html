               <h3>Republic Act No. 10630, also known as the "Act Establishing a Comprehensive Juvenile Justice and Welfare System," is a law in the Philippines that aims to promote the rights and welfare of children in conflict with the law. It provides a framework for the treatment and rehabilitation of children involved in criminal activities, emphasizing restorative justice principles rather than punitive measures.

            <h3>RA 10630 introduced significant changes to the juvenile justice system in the Philippines. It raises the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 9 to 15 years old, recognizing that children below this age lack the discernment to fully comprehend the consequences of their actions. The law also strengthens the role of the local social welfare and development office in handling juvenile cases and creating a community-based rehabilitation program.

            <h3>Additionally, RA 10630 emphasizes diversion programs and alternative measures for children in conflict with the law, such as counseling, rehabilitation, and reintegration into society. It promotes the principle of restorative justice, focusing on the well-being and best interests of the child offender.

Overall, RA 10630 aims to provide better protection and support for children who commit offenses, acknowledging their vulnerabilities and encouraging their reformation, rehabilitation, and reintegration into society.</h3>
